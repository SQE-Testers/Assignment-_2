Selection of Magento API Test:
I have selected the documentation of ParamOverriderCustomerIdTest.php
available at https://github.com/magento/magento2/blob/2.4-develop/app/code/Magento/Webapi/Test/Unit/Controller/Rest/ParamOverriderCustomerIdTest.php.

REST API:
There are other types of APIs used by Magento like SOAP but for the sake of documentation I am choosing REST API.A REST API is a way for two computer systems to communicate using the HTTP technologies found in web browsers and servers. Sharing data between two or more systems has always been a fundamental requirement of software development. For example, consider buying motor insurance.
